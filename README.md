# Deep Learning Practice

This repository contains my hands-on journey through **Deep Learning**, where I explore architectures and real-world problem solving using Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

## Topics Covered

### Deep Learning
- **Introduction to Neural Networks (ANN)**
- Overfitting, Dropout, Batch Normalization, Vanishing and Exploding Gradients, Regularization
- Activation Functions, Loss Functions, and Optimizers
- Deep Feedforward Networks using Keras/TensorFlow
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), LSTM, GRU**

## Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- PyTorch

## Goals
- Build strong foundations in Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Understand core mathematical concepts behind algorithms
- Work on real-world structured and image datasets
- Train and optimize neural networks effectively
